Disclaimer

I am not affiliated with Mossmouth or any of the developers of UFO 50. This project is a fan-made demake created for educational and recreational purposes.

All code in this project has been written from scratch by me, and no original art assets, sounds, or proprietary code from UFO 50 have been used. This is a terminal-based version, distinct from the original game.

Credits & Acknowledgment

Full credit for the original Party House minigame concept, design, and inspiration goes to Mossmouth, the developers of UFO 50.

Purpose of This Project

This project serves as:

    A programming exercise to recreate gameplay mechanics in a different environment.
    A way to explore demaking games for minimalistic platforms.
    A tribute to the creativity of UFO 50 and its developers.

I encourage everyone to play the original game when possible and support the developers!
